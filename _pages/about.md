I'm a PhD student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. I work in the [Mobile Intelligence Lab](http://netlab.cs.washington.edu) advised by [Prof. Shyam Gollakota](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/) and [Prof. Michael Taylor](http://michaeltaylor.org/). I'm interested in problems at the intersection of Mobile Computing, Machine Learning and Efficient Sensing. My recent work focusses on developing intelligent video and audio processing algorithms for IoT devices.

I got my Bachelor's degree in EE at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee and my Master's degree in ECE at the University of Washington. During my Master's, I worked with Prof. Michael Taylor on [porting PyTorch framework](https://github.com/cornell-brg/hb-pytorch) to a bespoke hardware accelerator. Previously, I worked on audio signal chain projects at Texas Instruments India.
