I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Washington. I work in the [Mobile Intelligence Lab](http://netlab.cs.washington.edu) advised by [Prof. Shyam Gollakota](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/) and [Prof. Michael Taylor](http://michaeltaylor.org/). I'm interested in Audio Processing, Machine Learning and Mobile Computing. My recent works focus on developing efficient audio & video processing algorithms for IoT devices.

I got my Bachelor's degree in EE at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee and my Master's degree in ECE at the University of Washington. During my Master's, I was advised by Prof. Michael Taylor, and developed a [deep learning framework](https://github.com/cornell-brg/hb-pytorch) for a bespoke hardware accelerator. Previously, I worked on audio processing ICs at Texas Instruments India.
